This repository contains notebooks where I explore a variety of structured datasets using statistical analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling techniques. The goal is to evaluate model performance across different algorithms—such as linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods—by analyzing metrics like R^2, RMSE, and residual distributions. Each notebook includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), and preprocessing steps to uncover meaningful insights.
